Star Wars Map Project
============

*Primary contributors:* **B_n,** J_ss.

This is an audacious, outlandish, and way-too-big-to-handle project, attempting to  
reconcile from the many sources, Legends and Canon alike, a single comprehensible  
resource for visualising and accessing the Star Wars galaxy.

#### Legends versus Canon
> As the primary author of the project is a fan of the Legends as much as the Canon, both are included. Legends is  
the default however, as it is much richer, and (generally) more interesting cartographically. The Canon universe is  
relatively quite sparse.

### Order of operations. 
* Initial file standards to be implemented.
* Expansion of Planet/System library.
* Site update to handle information, and present it.
* Python(?) to access and organise information (.xml) on pages.
* Prelim design of webviewer and mobile apps (iOs and Android, based on the design of the Exoplanet App by Hanno Rein).
* &c, &c..

### Standard Units:

gravity = 13.93 m.s-2  
Mass = 1.637x1025kg  
Radius = 8854km  


Other units and .xml children may be added at a later date. There are many. This project intends to be a rich resource containing more-than-enough and more-than-posssibly-useful information for research, RP and realism, and astrophysics purposes.


*There are some inconsistencies, especially in the standards used (Coruscants size) as they are derived from  
RPG material regarding Bespin and Yavin.*
